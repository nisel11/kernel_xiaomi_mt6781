	  This is used for Trusty to support MTK Geniezone
	  Irq will be masked in trusty irq handler
	  for irq routing to GenieZone.
	  Irq work will be put to global queue when cpu dead.
	  We move the GZ TIPC driver from drivers/trusty to
	  drivers/misc/mediatek/geniezone/gz-trusty. Use
	  MTK_ENABLE_GENIEZONE instead of TRUSTY to enable it.
